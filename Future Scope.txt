Note:

System always try to reach consensus for 2 players. To do the same for n players, update the "CONSENSUS_NUMBER" variable in "settings.py".
To include different components in questions, i.e. Audio, Text etc., Tasks can be prepared by randomly selecting a model for each question. For ex. randomly select Text to prepare one question and then  select Image for the next question and so on.
System supports notifying the admin when consensus is reached for all questions. To enable this, please uncomment the code line #44 on "questions/models.py" and update email credentials in settings.py.
